// Make a pop up/form, seperated by comas, of what types of froyo they would like to order
let request = prompt("Please type your froyo order here, make sure to use comas")
//Tested: Worked

//Turn the answers that were entered into the prompt be turned into an array
let froyoOrder = request.split(",");
// console.log(froyoOrder) Tested: Worked

//create an area (object) to store your answers
let orderImput = {};

//Now we need our array to be looped through to count the items
for (let flavors in froyoOrder){
    
}
